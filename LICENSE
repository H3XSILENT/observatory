Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

     Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in

     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
     For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
     2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
     adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms
     and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
     Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
     Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or import, but excluding making
     Available in connection with a free online service offering.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
     Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
     amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
     rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty‑free,
          non‑exclusive, irrevocable (for the duration of the Copyright
          and Similar Rights) license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
          modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
          Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
          modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
          Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution
          according to Section 3(a)(1)(A).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
          under this Public License, and this Public License does not
          apply to them. Licensor waives, to the extent required by the
          Attribution‑ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License, any
          exercise of moral rights that would otherwise restrict the
          exercise of the Licensed Rights, but this does not obligate
          the Licensor to assert or waive moral rights.

       2. Copyright and Similar Rights that apply in the Licensor's
          jurisdiction are licensed under this Public License, subject
          to the Licensor's waiver of any Exception and Limitation to
          the fullest extent legally possible.

       3. Sui Generis Database Rights. The Licensor hereby waives, to the
          extent required by the Attribution‑ShareAlike 4.0 International
          Public License, any Sui Generis Database Rights they may have
          over the Licensed Material, to the extent that the waiver is not
          legally possible, the Licensor undertakes not to assert those
          rights in a manner that would restrict the exercise of the
          Licensed Rights.

       4. Other database rights. Rights other than Sui Generis Database
          Rights are not licensed hereunder; they are excluded from the
          Licensed Rights.

       5. Waiver. To the extent permitted by law, the Licensor waives any
          right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the
          Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting
          society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme.

       6. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Licensed Material is a
          database, You are not required to comply with the terms and
          conditions of this Public License if You are only using the
          database as a cui generis database, and not using the Licensed
          Material in a way that would require copyright or similar rights.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

          and conditions of this Public License;

          License with the Adapted Material; and

       3. cause the Adapted Material to be marked with a credit notice
          as specified in Section 3(a)(1)(A).

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a product or service that You make Available, You must
     make that product or service available under the terms of this
     Public License or another license that is compatible with this
     Public License; and

     restrict the exercise of the rights granted under this Public
     License.

     SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING
     DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
     ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE
     LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  c. This Section 5 is not intended to limit any rights a recipient may
     have under the applicable Exceptions and Limitations.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. The term of this Public License is the duration of the Copyright
     and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply
     with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public
     License terminate automatically.
