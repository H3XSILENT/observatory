Mapping attack surface with rigor, clarity, and methodology.

This repository gathers an organized collection of studies, techniques, and processes used in bug bounty and offensive security, with focus on two areas that usually receive superficial attention:

1. Reconnaissance — the process of understanding the real structure of a target.  
2. Reporting — the art of communicating vulnerabilities in a professional and verifiable way.

The goal is not to compile tool lists or ready‑made exploits.  
It is to document **how to think**, **how to map**, and **how to analyze** — elements that truly differentiate a competent hunter from someone who only repeats tutorials.
